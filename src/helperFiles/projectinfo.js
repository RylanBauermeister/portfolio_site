const homeSafeDescription = "HomeSafe was developed with the belief that people should feel safe when they walk around their city. The app is a user-centric interactive crime map fo the city of Seattle which allows users to dynamically weight crime types to fit what they want to avoid. It also allows for user interaction in the form of being able to create and like reports (which are visible to all users) and avoids (which are visible only to the user who created them). All in all, it's an application with the safety of its users in mind."

const mixxyDescription = "Mixxy is a fun little project designed to allow users to find and store cocktail recipes. With a playful aesthetic and jaunty music, Mixxy is half throwback to older schools of design, half casino bartender. It utilizes JWT login to keep user profiles distinct and secure, and React Router to ensure that the process of navigating the site is quick and painless to its users."

const trosDescription = "t.roS is my love letter to sorting algorithms. While I've always had a passion for the elegance of a well written sort, I think there is a great deal of aethetic satisfaction to be had in watching them do their magic. t.roS, as a result, is a sorting algorithm visualizer that allows you to play with things like swap, compare, and access times in order to better see how each of five different sorting algorithms can work on your data."

const donationNationDescription = "DonationNation is a slightly tongue-in-cheek take on a social media site that revolves around the ability to make cash donations from one use to another. Users can make profiles, review, message, and make donations to other users. They are in turn notified if another user performs any of those other actions with them.  Built purely on Rails, DonationNation is an early exploration of what it looks like to build a basic social media platform."

const mealwormDescription = "Mealworm is a CLI for chefs. It uses API queries from a Ruby backend to find recipes based on input strings, then save them to a database of recipes for the specific user. It also walks users through the steps to cook the recipes they have acquired, and then rate/anotate after they are done. Finally, it even provides a shopping list for the user based on the recipes they have selected for cooking. This robust little CLI is an excellent tool for any tech-savvy chef."
